# Exports

## Excel Generation

- **SheetJS pipeline:** The popup uses SheetJS to convert the current table view into an `.xlsx` file without server calls.
- **Column parity:** Exported columns mirror the on-screen table so offline reviewers see identical data.
- **File naming:** Exports are timestamped to reflect when analysis was generated.
